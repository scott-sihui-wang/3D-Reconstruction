# 3D-Reconstruction

## 1. Introduction

In this project, the goals are:

- Recover `fundamental matrices` and `essential matrices` from `stereo` images for depth estimation and 3D reconstruction;
  
- `Pose estimation` from 2D - 3D corresponding points.

For a more thourough introduction of my project, please refer to my [report](report.pdf).

**Topics:** _Computer Vision_, _Homography Estimation_, _Video Stitching_

**Skills:** _Matlab_

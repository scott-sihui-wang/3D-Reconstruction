# 3D-Reconstruction

## 1. Introduction

In this project, I first implemented `homography estimation` by feature point extraction, matching, and `RANSAC`. Then, I used the computation of `planar homography` to stitch two video scenarios together to generate an "augmented reality" scene.

For a more thourough introduction of my project, please refer to my [report](report.pdf).
